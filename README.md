### Experience

[Booking.com](https://www.booking.com) | Machine Learning Engineer 
---: | :---
Jan 2018 – Present Amsterdam, NL | A key contributor to the core machine learning products, implementing models with high volumes of traffic. Ensured quality code and regular deployments through automated testing and continuous integration pipelines. Organised and led a the development of machine learning stories to increase the net bookings of my team by 80%.

[Machinalis](https://www.machinalis.com/) | Machine Learning Engineer
---: | :---
Mar 2017 – Dec 2017 Córdoba, Argentina | Machinalis was the biggest Data Science company in Argentina and was later acquired by [MercadoLibre.com](https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/mercadolibre-acquires-machinalis--8648f5e0) (the biggest e-commerce company in Latin America). As my first taste of development on a large scale, I quickly learned how vital communication and effective collaboration are for complex software to succeed. I worked mostly in text classification problems, making the classification of products easier for the customers. 

[University of Southern California](https://ict.usc.edu/about/) | Visitor Research Assistant
---: | :---
May 2017 – Sep 2017 Los Angeles, California | I spent 4 months doing research in the Institute for Creative Technologies, which is a part of the University of Southern California. I led the project to develop a "metadialogue" agent, capable of generating stories about random subjects and combined it with different existing technologies there.  

[Universidad Nacional de Córdoba](https://www.unc.edu.ar/) | Teaching Assistant
---: | :---
Mar 2016 – Mar 2017 Córdoba, Argentina | I have been always been passionate about teaching and leading. I was selected to spent a year as a teaching assitant, participating in the practical classes of both "Introduction to Algorithms" and "Algorithms and Data Structures I".  

[IMDEA Software](https://software.imdea.org/people/ignacio.queralt/index.html) | Software Research Intern
---: | :---
Sept 2015 – Dec 2015 Madrid, Spain | I love to learn new things and try new technologies, therefore I spent 4 months trying to find vulnerabilities in the Google V8 machine. This was mostly a combination of research and programming. 

[INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/fr) | Software Research Intern
---: | :---
March 2014 – Sep 2014 Nancy, France | It's not mandatory for students to do research internships while their study at my University, but I really wanted to learn more about software and I was quite interested in Model Checking at the time, so I spent 6 months doing research in the VeriDis team, in Nancy.

### Education
[Universidad Nacional de Córdoba](https://www.unc.edu.ar/) | Postgraduate courses in Machine Learning and Big Data
---: | :---
Jul 2016 – Dec 2016 | As an advanced student in the career, I was qualified to pursue postgraduate courses in my University and enrolled in two postgraduate courses (valid as courses of PhD students). The two courses were called "Machine Learning in Computer Vision" and "Distributed Programming in Big Data".

[Universidad Nacional de Córdoba](https://www.unc.edu.ar/) | Bachelor and Master's in Computer Science
---: | :---
Mar 2011 – Dec 2016 | My thesis was about natural language generation and is called "Generating plural referring expressions using model theory". This was a combination of logic theory and artifical intelligence used for language generation. In addition to this, I was the first student to graduate from my class of over 300 students.

### Programming contests
- Participated in the 2014 Regional ACM – ICPC South America South, representing the Universidad
Nacional de Córdoba.
- Participated in the 2013 and 2014 ACM – ICPC style competition TAP: “Argentinian Programming
Tournament” and classified to the regional ACM – ICPC South America Contest.
